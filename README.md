What is Power Stage Designer?

Power Stage Designer is a Java-based design tool developed by Texas Instruments (TI). It’s made for engineers who design switched-mode power supplies (SMPS) and want to quickly calculate and evaluate different topologies.

Key Features:

Supports 21 different power supply topologies.

Provides real-time waveforms and operating values (voltage, current, duty cycle, etc.).

Includes a set of handy calculators, such as:

Loop calculator – helps design compensation networks.

Load step calculator – suggests minimum output capacitor values.

MOSFET loss calculator.

Capacitor RMS current sharing.

RC and RCD snubber calculators.

Voltage divider calculator (for feedback networks).

AC bulk capacitor calculator.

Unit converter.

Advantages:

Instead of running heavy simulations, it gives instant theoretical results for selected topologies.

Saves time in the early design phase of power supplies.

Still, results should be verified with SPICE simulations and lab measurements before final implementation.
